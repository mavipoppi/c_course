The syntax of this statement is as follows:

do
    program statement;
while (loop_expression);

The execution proceed as follows: the program statement is executed first. Next, the loop_expression inside the parentheses is evaluated. If the result of evaluating the loop_expression is TRUE, the loop continues and the program statement is once again executed.  When evalutation of the expression proves FALSE, the loop is terminated. 

OBS: unlike the for and while loops, the do statement guarantees that the body of the loop is executed at least once. 

An example of this statement is given in 6_do_example.
