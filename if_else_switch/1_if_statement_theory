The general format of this statement is

if ( expression )
    program statement 

For example, if you want to translate a statement such as "If its not raining, than I will go swimming into C language, you could write 

if (it is not raining)
    I will go swimming

The if condition is used to estipulate execution of a program statement based upon specified conditions. 

Another example:

if (count > count_limit)
    printf("Count limit exceeded\n");

the printf statement is executed only if the value of count is greater than the value of count_limit; otherwise, it is ignored.
